Title: Bikes of Yore

Description: A site that displays classic bicycle brands as they've evolved from their early days
to the present. When you hover over a picture of a classic bike, it changes to a modern image.

How I went above and beyond:

1. Taking advantage of Vue's component system, I allow the user to toggle between slideshow view and
   gallery view.
2. The site is fully responsive.
3. I created a full webpage with realistic functionality and style.
